									<h1>The eyes that saw what couldn't be seen</h1>
									<p>&ldquo;I am not what you see.<br>
									  I am what time and effort and interaction slowly unveil.&rdquo;<br>

								<p>I was always fascinated by how our senses can play an integral role in getting to know someone better because what you can feel can directly translate to what you will be seeing. For example knowing that someone is talking to you just so that they can borrow your homework makes their once friendly interactions seem like a lie causing you to feel a different way towards someone </p>
								<p>Admittedly when i first saw you i knew there was more to you than what was laid out in fron ti knew that there was maturity behind those eyes and pain behind that laugh that resonated through every facit of my being </p>
								<p>The more i got to know you the more time i spend with you the more of you gets uncovered and i'm always excited everyday to find out a new part of you to uncover, a new part of you to love and adore</p>
								<p>People are blind to not hold on to you tightly or give you the love that you deserve, i would you the world in fact that is what i am planning on if not i will give you the universe all in the palm of your hand for you to play around with or rule over </p>
								<p>Whenever i'm with you i see someone brave someone with a heart so big and kind that i can not help but admire you for maintaining such humanity. In a time period where people would rather be soicipathic or psychopathic you remained in tune with your humanity</p>
								<p>Do not take this the wrong way but for someone as young as you to be doing what you are doing now deserves nothing but respect and high praise. I see the sweat that you are pouring, i see your struggles and the obstacles you want to overcome, i see your determination to be better and honestly sometimes i find myself motivated by you </p>
								<p>That's why i decided to learn how to code to some extent just so i can maybe make you something that only i can make or i can say. i want to give this special girl something special to her, something only she knows about, something she will never need to share with anyone </p>
								<p>Of course i'm yours forever, i am all yours and you won't need to share me not even for a second with anyone else. You have me all to yourself, don't feel bad or weird for being attached, obsessed or even addicted to me because i love it </p>
								<p>It pains me everyday to see you and others leave your beauty unaddressed like oh my god you are so beautiful and pretty i literally can not put it into words how beautiful you are to me. Everytime you smile, everytime you laugh i can not help but laugh and smile to</p>
								<p>I may look like i am not affected but believe me when i say i get more than just buterflies in my stomach, my heart doesn't just skip a singular beat and for certain even though i have known you for sometime now i am still not immune to it </p>
								<p>You know how much words mean to me, i would not lie about how i feel towards you. Please believe me when i say you do this to me and so much more.	I	find	myself	blushing	at	new things almost every single day. Things that i wouldn't find cute on anyone else if absolutely adorable on you </p>
								<p>Babe if you think i don't see every aspect of who you are and if you think that i will be affected by who you were or what you have done then guess what that is not happening.	I	saw	who	you	are	and	i	know every shade of it and i am in love with all of it </p>
