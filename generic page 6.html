									<h1>a secret</h1>
									<p>&ldquo;If you want to keep a secret, you must also hide it from yourself.&rdquo;<br>
								    ― George Orwell,  <span id="quote_book_link_5470"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/153313">1984</a></span></p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/posta6.jfif" alt="" /></div>
								<p>You know how much this secret meant to me and how hard it was to tell you of course i could sit here and write all about it, how hard it was to say it or what i had to do, the amount of practice i had to go through just so that i can say it to you but even then i failed miserabliy to say it without losing my cool</p>
								<p>It was never in my genes to be cool then i guess. You accepted me for who i am and what i am and with that i can not thank you enough for allowing me to relieve this much baggage. It does not affect you or the people around you in any sort of way but to me it did </p>
								<p>I started feeling like i could be myself again and regain what i have lost. Sometimes i wonder if you even know how much you have helped me because i could name a couple and we still will be touching the tip of the ice berg</p>
								<p>You've been the best and you will always be the best, thank you for aceepting who i really am </p>
