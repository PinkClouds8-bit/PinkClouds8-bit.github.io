									<h1>The girl who knocked on the palace gates</h1>
									<p>&ldquo;Bran thought about it. 'Can a man still be brave if he's afraid?'<br>
									  'That is the only time a man can be brave,' his father told him.&rdquo;<br>
								    ― George R.R. Martin,  <span id="quote_book_link_13496"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/1466917">A Game of Thrones</a></span></p>

								<p>I know how scary it is to be at the receiving end of the palace completely unaware of what it could do or say to change up the whole system. It is terrifying in every way shape or form. Not knowing if what you are saying is helping or just making it worst, not knowing where you are heading and it's a blind little chase</p>
								<p>I felt like an outcast with my palace i thougth no one will ever know about it, i thought to myself maybe i am the only one who has one of these places to this extent that is but it was later that i found out tyler from twenty one pilots has his own little place called &quot;Dema&quot;</p>
								<p>I soon felt like i was not as different as i amde myself out to be and you showing me acceptance at every corner, being there for every time that i am in the palace i can not thank you enough for all that you have done. You are getting better at handling it and now that we have a solid layout of it, you will be able to help me escape it everytime and who knows maybe even break it some day </p>
								<p>I have faith in you and i now you will be able to pull me out no matter how deep i am into the palace of mirrors. i know i can alwasy rely on you </p>
