									<h1>The question was asked</h1>
									<p>&ldquo;Most misunderstandings in the world could be avoided if people would simply take the time to ask, "What else could this mean?&rdquo;<br>

								<p>Like most people i ponder and wonder about things that to an extent of almost obsessing over it until i get an answer. Thanks to this trait of mine i have useless knowledge about certain topics that people will never bring out in conversation. This isn't even a party trick that i can use since facts about hangers aren't really party pleasers unless the party in question are full of hanger addicts</p>
								<p>I was hurt really badly about 2 years ago by someone who haunts me till this day, i have tried my best to surpress it and make it simmer down but sometimes it get's the best of me</p>
								<p>When i started developing these feelings for you i wanted to be sure i wanted to know for a fact that this isn't just loneliness talking, that this not just a mere little crush that will be resolved within the span of 3 months i wanted to be certain </p>
								<p>I kept asking myself question about how i feel about you and why i feel this way about. Whether i should trust you or let you into my world. Terrified as i was i wanted to give you a fair evaluation with no basis with no barriers to with hold my rational </p>
								<p>I only evaluated myself during the days i was level headed, was not tired or haven't had a rough day. Wanting to be in the perfect state of mind to see if i truly have feelings for you andi'm really glad that i did ask that question and i am really glad that for as stupid and almost messy this process was to understand my feelings </p>
								<p>I was glad i did because of it i was able to realise that my feelings for you are not just a little crush but pure unadulterated	love	with	no	strings	attached.	</p>
