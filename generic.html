									<h1>How it all started </h1>
									<p>&ldquo;A story has no beginning or end: arbitrarily one chooses that moment of experience from which to look back or from which to look ahead.&rdquo;<br>

								<p>Good morning or evening or night i don't really know when you will be reading this and for anyone else who isn't the person this website was meant for welcome and join the ride as i tell you and her of the tales of how we met, how we became closer and how the choices we made on that day completely changed the days that came after </p>
								<p>December 1st of 2019 was the beginning even though you could argue that back then we couldn't have foreshadowed what was to come from our little interaction</p>
								<p>I was roaming around an application that to us is second nature. I hopped from one group chat to another hopping to find someone to talk to or make friends with. At the time i didn't really talk to anoyone on a daily basis i sort of bounced from one person to another without really thinking once or twice about who i was talking to </p>
								<p>I joined this groupchat whose name was familiar to me, the host had her chat banned more than once and it kept happening over the course of a week to the point that i depended on her to invite me</p>
								<p>It's true i knew her and the people there in fact you could say i was a regular but i never felt like i truly fitted in but one day you came into that group </p>
								<p>I was already use to talking to a large group of people even though i didn't like being in one but on that day i felt like i could and i'm glad that i decided to listen in to my arrogance for once </p>
								<p>There i met you, a sweet little girl with a voice that stuck to my head, distinguishable from the crowd. With an accent that even though to your ears you consider ugly, i on the other hand enjoyed beyond descriptions of the words </p>
								<p>I decided to come in more to the chat in hopes you would drop by and drop by you did </p>
								<p>I wanted to text you at the time but i never felt like i should or had a good enough reason to. Usually people text me first and that was a law i abided by my entire life but with you i felt compelled to text you first but i had to find a reason first </p>
								<p>Somehow whether by sheer luck or some other thing we kind of started talking more in the group chat, not in private but in public.	We	joined	this	one	chat	with	a man who was nice, you knew him too. i don't know if you consider him a friend but to the looks of it, you did to some extent due to him removing you, you felt outcasted or unfairly ruled </p>
								<p>I thought it was unfair too because i was the one starting up the vulgar comments and prolonged them yet you were punished for it. Soon after your removal i contacted you and started talking to you. At first i admit it was awkward from both sides but through my stubborness and your kindness we got closer</p>
								<p>Even though till this day you probably think those random skype calls at 3am in the morning annoyed me or was too much since we just knew each for a week back then. i am glad that you called and will forever be </p>
