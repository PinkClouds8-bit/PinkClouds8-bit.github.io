								<p>For your birthday i had something special planned for you but because i certain compnay didn't work with me as good as it does with others plus other complications too my gift didn't make it to you at all but i wil get it to you one day and when it does get to you i hope that you will take lots of pictures of you and the teddy bear </p>
								<p>I had a speech and or a letter that i was going to recite to you on the day of your birthday but since it was on a school day and as soon as you were home we didn't really have time to talk i had to keep my little cringy and hopeless romantic letter to myself. Don't worry you're not missing out on a lot</p>
								<p>All i will say though is i am glad that you were born and you've grown into a wonderful woman. i am proud of the decisions you have made and the progress you have made so far this year, i know you wil be capable of doing some much more in the future </p>
								<p>What you have done right now at the first quarter of the year is enough you have done really well for yourself and i can not be any prouder than i am to be yours and to watch this cute little babe grow to somebody she wanted to be </p>
								<p>Their will be more struggles to face in the future but i will be there for each and every single one of them. I will be there for every celebration to come and to be made. You won't spend those special moments alone and if there aren't many or any then i will make more of them for you</p>
